# UserRegistration
"This is a Spring Boot project with a PostgreSQL database that allows for complete user registration, including email confirmation. Upon registration, the user will receive an email with a confirmation link. The user has 15 minutes to confirm their email address before the registration process is canceled. This project is a great starting point for building secure and reliable user registration systems in your applications."
